## Overview
This document contains all character and faction profiles for the game. Player will interact with these entities through contracts, competition, and story events.

---

## Player Character
- **Name**: Player-defined (defaults to "Commander")
- **Role**: CEO of startup asteroid mining company
- **Background**: Player chooses from engineer, astronomer, economist, or business developer.
- **Starting Advantages**: each background option has perks that come with it.   Engineer will give accelerated tech tree unlock and less likelihood of anomaly during failure,   astronomer will give 10% faster travel time due to optimal pathing and more likelihood of bonus materials found on asteroids,  economist will get higher variance in material cost of resell and purchase and can find better trade opportunities,  and business developer will get better rates renting equipment and storage.

## Competitor Mining Companies

### Competitor 1
- **Name**: Rock Lobster Industries
- **CEO**: Kiki Lobster (founder, influencer, venture cult icon)
- **Specialty**: Experimental nano-miners and AI-driven swarm extraction
- **Behavior**: Disruptive, hype-driven, launches first and files permits later
- **Threat Level**: Medium — chaotic tech, unpredictable outcomes.  Likley to mine on an asteroid your ships are headed towards.

### Competitor 2
- **Name**: Solar System Quarry and Drill
- **CEO**: Reginald P. Stone
- **Specialty**: Industrial-scale strip mining with military-grade logistics
- **Behavior**: Procedural, unionized, documented, terrifyingly efficient
- **Threat Level**: Low, highest cost competitor and slow, but always completes it's mission and never faces pirate activity.

### Competitor 3
- **Name**: Belt Brothers Salvage
- **CEO**: Mad Dog Aphelion
- **Specialty**: Asset recovery, wreck stripping, legally ambiguous repossessions, bribery-friendly, always circling distressed ships
- **Behavior**: Opportunistic, bribery-friendly, always circling distressed ships
- **Threat Level**: High - often goes after asteroids you are headed towards, sometimes while you are mining them, under bids and fails to deliver sometimes (20% chance they fail to complete a contract, creating opportunity for player to steal the contract with time bonus).

## Space Pirates

### Pirate Faction 1
- **Name**: Blackstar Beard 
- **Leader**: Edward Thatch
- **Territory**: Asteroid Belt
- **Tactics**: patrols belt, rarley attacks, but goes hard on attack when they do.
- **Threat Level**: low, rarley attacks

### Pirate Faction 2

## Contract Providers

### Government Agencies
- **NASA**: Eternally optimistic explorers running on spreadsheets, coffee, and congressional hearings; contracts request “small experimental payloads” that quietly become decade-long flagship missions
- **ESA**: Multinational committee-powered precision machine where every bolt has diplomatic approval; contracts favor elegant, overengineered science platforms that must survive 40 years and a budget debate
- **JAXA**: Masters of ultra-efficient robotics and polite emails; contracts seek impossibly delicate sample returns that must arrive spotless and perfectly labeled
- **Private Space Stations**: Venture-funded orbital co-working spaces with sponsorship logos on the cupola; contracts focus on rush deliveries of boutique materials for zero-G tourism, manufacturing demos, and influencer livestreams

### Corporations
- **Tech Companies**: Cheerful monopolies chasing the next trillion-dollar device; contracts demand rare elements yesterday to build thinner, faster gadgets that will be obsolete before the ore cools
- **Manufacturing**: Planet-scale supply chains that consider asteroids a “logistics optimization opportunity”; contracts request bulk raw material shipments measured in megatons and delivered on strict quarterly schedules
- **Energy Companies**: Former oil giants reinvented as asteroid ice barons; contracts revolve around harvesting volatiles for propellant depots, fuel futures, and interplanetary gas station empires
- **Pharmaceutical**: Research conglomerates convinced the cure for everything is hiding in a weird rock; contracts seek exotic compounds and microgravity-grown crystals with 900-page handling instructions

## Robot Vendors

### Vendor 1
- **Name**: KÜKA-Cola Robotics
- **Specialty**: Industrial arms that look like they belong in a museum but will outlive the museum
- **Product Line**: Brutalist orange mining rigs, drill spiders, and assembly platforms that run on 40-year-old code nobody dares touch

## Security Contractors

### Contractor 1
- **Name**: Pinkerton Orbital Recovery Bureau
- **Background**: 200-year-old investigation firm that simply refused to stay on Earth
