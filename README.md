# Asteroid Miner

A 3D resource management simulation game where you run an asteroid mining company in our solar system.

## Overview

Play as the CEO of an asteroid mining operation, sending robotic and human crews to mine resources from real asteroids and comets. Navigate contracts, manage economics, unlock technologies, and defend against space pirates—all while learning real orbital mechanics, spacecraft systems, and solar system science.

## Features

- **Real Solar System**: Navigate a 3D WebGL solar system with real asteroids and comets
- **Real Science**: Actual orbital mechanics, NASA data, and educational content
- **Strategic Gameplay**: Contract management, sub-contractor selection, tech tree progression
- **Economic Simulation**: Dynamic markets, resource trading, warehouse management
- **Educational**: Learn about space vehicles, orbital mechanics, and solar system resources
- **No Account Required**: URL-based save system, fully client-side

## Technology

- **TypeScript** - Compiled to JavaScript for maintainability
- **WebGL** - 3D graphics rendering
- **Three.js** - 3D library (recommended)
